#  Poetry Landing Page

This is a simple, soft, and scroll-worthy **Poetry Landing Page** — built purely out of curiosity using just **HTML** and **CSS**.

As someone who loves writing poetry, I wanted to create a little corner on the web that visually reflects my vibe.  
No JavaScript. No frameworks. Just calm design and creative intent.

##  Why I Made This

I enjoy writing poems that come straight from the heart — and I thought, why not create a page that holds that energy too?

This landing page was an experiment to:
- Learn layout, fonts, and styling in pure HTML/CSS
- Explore aesthetic web design without distractions
- Give my poems a digital home someday ✨

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML** – For structure  
- **CSS** – For soft vibes, spacing, and styling

##  Status

This is a creative side project — always open to being improved as I explore more ideas.
